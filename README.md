# space-syntax (Hayyiz)
This open-source implementation of space syntax analysis (axial/segment) offers user-friendly functions that can be easily customized and modified to include new experimental features, with minimal coding expertise required. The code supports the following analyses for both Integration and Choice:
1. Axial analysis
2. Segment analysis, including angular and normalized analysis
3. Depth analysis (giving a metric distance from an axial line(s); the outcome is a polygon with the routes that can reach within the given radius)
4. Additional experimental analyses will be introduced in a few months.
